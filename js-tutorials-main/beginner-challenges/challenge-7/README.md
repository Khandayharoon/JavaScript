# Challenge 7: Filter negative numbers
We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-7. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

Use an array and filter out the negative numbers. Don't use the built-in functions for filtering.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Make your solution reusable so that it works with an abitrary number.

# Bonus II

Make your solution interactible with the HTML file.
