# Challenge 1: Print all even numbers from 0 - 10

We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-1. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

In this challenge, you will create an array with values from 0 to 10. Log the output to the console, so you can check it up in the browser.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github.

# Bonus I

Make your solution reusable so that you can change the number.

# Bonus II

Make your solution work in the attached 'index.html' file. Let the user pick a number and attach the numbers to the html.
